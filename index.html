    <h1>ML TEAM 89 - Project Proposal</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction/Background</h2>
    <p>
        Stars, galaxies, and quasars need to be classified to analyze the structures of celestial formations. 
        While telescope observations may be enough, datasets featuring different celestial objects can help classify them autonomously. 
        We will classify stars, galaxies, and quasars in this project.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Literature Review</h2>
    <p>
        There are several methods to classify celestial objects currently using ML. 
        A 2023 paper compares Random Forest, XGBoost, and K-NN for classifying galaxies, quasars, and stars (Zeraatgari et al.). 
        This paper reported high accuracy for XGBoost and ensemble learning that included Random Forest (Zeraatgari et al.). 
        Research suggests that the most important groups of features for classification are photometry, colors, and morphology (von Marttens et al., 2023). 
        Deep learning methods have also been used on SDSS data that showed how CNNs and photometric images can be used for classification, with a peak accuracy of 90.7% (He et al., 2021). 
        In comparison to XGBoost and Random Forest’s accuracy of 98.93%, deep learning methods may not perform as well but offer a suitable alternative (Zeraatgari et al.).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Dataset Description</h2>
    <p>
        The “Stellar Classification Dataset” is from Kaggle. The data is compiled from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 17. 
        There are 100,000 rows of data with 17 features/columns. The 18th column is the class, which includes the labels for the data. 
        The labels can be GALAXY, STAR, or QSO (quasar).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Problem Definition</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Over 200 probes have been sent to explore celestial bodies outside Earth’s orbit. 
        A significant number of these have even been sent into interstellar space. 
        These probes were sent to broaden our understanding of the universe, and as data started flowing in, it was important to catalogue these bodies. 
        We are mainly focusing on stars, galaxies, and quasars. 
        The dataset we are using compiles the characteristics used to do this early cataloguing as well as the results obtained from it.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Motivation</h3>
    <p>
        Stellar objects such as stars and galaxies are observable to the naked eye. 
        However, what we see is just a twinkle in the night sky. 
        To truly know the role these objects play, it is important to classify them correctly. 
        By leveraging data collected by probes, we can use ML and statistical analysis to distinguish between stars, galaxies, and quasars, 
        furthering our understanding of the universe.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Methods</h2>
    <p>
        To perform ML analysis, we need a plan for preprocessing and ML model methods that will train the model and evaluate performance. 
        We break our methods into two parts: data preprocessing and supervised ML modeling.
    </p>

    <h3>6.1 Preprocessing</h3>
    <p>
        We plan to use feature pruning to remove insignificant columns (e.g., identifiers). 
        SKLearn function transformers will be applied for feature engineering (e.g., brightness features). 
        The dataset is relatively clean, but we will use imputers for missing data. 
        Large values will be standardized for computational efficiency. 
        Class balancing will be applied since the classes have different sample sizes.
    </p>

    <h3>6.2 Machine Learning Models</h3>
    <p>
        We will use SciKitLearn’s libraries and fine-tune models based on requirements. 
        Models include Logistic Regression, SVMs, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPs).
    </p>

    <h2>7. Results and Discussion</h2>
    <p>
        Our primary metric will be accuracy. We will also analyze per-class precision and F1 scores to avoid majority-class dominance. 
        The project goals are to find high accuracy and identify the best-performing model, while ensuring computational efficiency. 
        We expect high accuracies overall, with MLPs (for complex features) and Random Forests (for correlated features) likely performing best.
